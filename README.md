**Project Description**\
\
This project will study how the feedback received by MTA customers has influenced or driven the MTA to allocate their Capital (via Capital Programs) strategically to tackle the current issues. In other words, the research question that will be addressed throughout the project is : "To what extent does the MTA\'92s data recollection influence their Capital Investment Allocation, as a means to improve costumer experience?". To restore, improve, and expand this irreplaceable public asset. The MTA has implemented capital programs between 1982 and 2018. As the MTA continues to improve and expand under its 2010-2014, as well as its 2015-2019 Capital Program. It is accelerating critical improvements to its century-old subway system under the Subway Action Plan, announced in July 2017, which aims at both immediate performance gains and a thoroughly modernised subway system to serve New York in the 21st century.}
